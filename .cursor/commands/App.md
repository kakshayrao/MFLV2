## 2. User Roles & Permissions (Implementation Guide)

### Role Hierarchy & Permissions Matrix

| Action | Host | Governor | Captain | Player |
|--------|------|----------|---------|--------|
| Create League | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Edit League (pre-launch) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Delete League (pre-launch) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View All Teams/Players | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Validate Any Submission | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Validate Team Submissions | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Override Captain Decision | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Access Oversight Dashboard | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage Team (own only) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Submit Workouts | ✅* | ✅* | ✅ | ✅ |
| View Personal Dashboard | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

*Only if also assigned as Player in the league.

### Multi-Role Support

**Allowed Combinations:**
- Host + Player (host participates in own league)
- Governor + Player (governor submits workouts)
- Captain + Player (captains are implicitly players; all captains can submit)
- Player only (default)

**Not Allowed:**
- Captain of multiple teams in same league
- Host + Governor simultaneously (Host has full Governor permissions)

**Implementation:**
- Store roles in `league_members` table: `role` enum (host, governor, captain, player)
- A user can have multiple roles per league (one row per role, or composite enum field)
- Middleware checks `token.role` or fetches from session; UI shows role switcher dropdown
- Role switcher updates current session role; determines visible dashboards and menus

## 3. Database Schema

### Actual Schema (Current)

Your database implements a comprehensive role-based system with challenges and activity tracking. Below is the actual structure:

#### users
```sql

### Schema Design Notes & Recommendations

#### ✅ What's Working Well
- **Comprehensive role system** — `assignedrolesforleague` table supports multi-role per league
- **Challenge system** — Well-designed with individual and team scoring
- **Activity types** — Master `activities` table enables custom activity selection per league
- **OTP handling** — `email_otps` table properly implements OTP workflow
- **Audit trails** — `created_by`, `created_date`, `modified_by`, `modified_date` on most tables

#### ⚠️ Issues to Fix

**1. CRITICAL: Duplicate FK constraints in leaguemembers**
```sql
-- Current (INVALID - will fail at runtime):
CONSTRAINT fk_lm_team_league FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES public.teamleagues(team_id),
CONSTRAINT fk_lm_team_league FOREIGN KEY (league_id) REFERENCES public.teamleagues(team_id),
CONSTRAINT fk_lm_team_league FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES public.teamleagues(league_id),
CONSTRAINT fk_lm_team_league FOREIGN KEY (league_id) REFERENCES public.teamleagues(league_id)

-- Correct:
CONSTRAINT fk_lm_team FK (team_id) REFERENCES public.teams(team_id),
CONSTRAINT fk_lm_league FK (league_id) REFERENCES public.leagues(league_id)
```
**Action:** Fix these constraints immediately; they prevent table creation/modification.

**2. Missing audit columns in effortentry**
Add to track who approved submissions and when:
```sql
validated_by UUID FK (users) -- who approved/rejected
validated_at TIMESTAMP -- when approved/rejected
```

**3. Potential redundancy: teamleagues vs. leaguemembers**
- `teamleagues` links teams to leagues
- `leaguemembers` already has `team_id` and `league_id`
- Consider: Do you need both? `teamleagues` could be eliminated if team_id uniquely identifies team per league.
- Current design allows teams to span multiple leagues (good for flexibility).
- Keep both if teams can be reused across leagues; otherwise simplify.

**4. Missing: payments table for Stripe integration**
Add this table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
  payment_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL FK (users),
  league_id UUID NOT NULL FK (leagues),
  stripe_payment_intent VARCHAR,
  stripe_session_id VARCHAR,
  status VARCHAR (e.g., 'pending', 'completed', 'failed'),
  amount DECIMAL,
  currency VARCHAR DEFAULT 'USD',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

**5. Missing: leaderboard_cache table (performance optimization)**
Add this table for cached leaderboard scores (refreshed hourly or on submission):
```sql
CREATE TABLE leaderboard_cache (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  league_id UUID NOT NULL FK (leagues),
  league_member_id UUID NOT NULL FK (leaguemembers),
  rank INT,
  points INT,
  avg_rr DECIMAL,
  streak INT,
  week_number INT,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

**6. Missing: leagues table columns for PRD features**
Current `leagues` table is minimal. Add these for PRD support:
```sql
ALTER TABLE leagues ADD COLUMN (
  is_exclusive BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  num_teams INT,
  team_size INT,
  rest_days INT,
  stripe_product_id VARCHAR,
  status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'draft' -- e.g., 'draft', 'launched', 'active', 'completed'
);
```

**7. leagues table: add host_id reference**
```sql
ALTER TABLE leagues ADD COLUMN host_id UUID NOT NULL FK (users);
```
This makes it explicit who created (hosts) the league, simplifying access control queries.

---

### Performance Considerations

1. **Indexes needed:**
   - `leaguemembers(league_id, user_id)` — for fast membership lookup
   - `effortentry(league_member_id, date, status)` — for submission queries
   - `assignedrolesforleague(league_id, user_id)` — for role lookups
   - `specialchallengeindividualuserscore(league_id, challenge_id)` — for challenge leaderboards

2. **Leaderboard cache:**
   - Pre-compute and cache leaderboard scores hourly or on submission approval
   - Avoid computing rank/points on every leaderboard request

3. **RLS policies:**
   - Apply at table level (not rows) for role-based access
   - Users can see only their own leagues and teams
   - Governors can see all data in their leagues

## 4. Database to Services Mapping

This section maps actual DB tables to the `src/lib/services/*` layer (future consolidation). Use these functions to centralize DB logic and avoid duplication across API routes and components.

| Table(s) | Service File | Key Functions | Usage |
|----------|--------------|---|---|
| `users` | `lib/services/users.ts` | `getUserById(id)`, `getUsersByIds(ids[])`, `isUsernameTaken(username, excludeId?)`, `updateUserProfile(userId, changes)` | Auth, profile updates, user lookups |

## 5. Core Features & Implementation Path

### 5.1 Authentication & User Management

**Status:** ✅ Mostly implemented  
**Implemented In:**
- `src/lib/auth/config.ts` — NextAuth configuration
- `src/app/api/auth/*` — Auth endpoints (OTP, password, profile completion)
- `src/middleware.ts` — Session checks, redirects

**Guidance:**
- Keep JWT callback minimal (no DB reads during token refresh)
- Use `/api/auth/refresh-profile` endpoint for profile completion updates
- Client calls `session.update({ name, needsProfileCompletion })` after profile changes
- All auth flows must update the session token immediately for UI consistency

---

### 5.2 League Creation & Management

**Status:** 🟡 Placeholder endpoints exist; logic needed  
**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/leagues` — Create league
- `GET /api/leagues` — List leagues
- `GET /api/leagues/[id]` — Get league details
- `PATCH /api/leagues/[id]` — Update (Host only, pre-launch)

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Validate Host role before creation
- [ ] Generate join link (league slug or token)
- [ ] Enforce "rules immutable after launch"
- [ ] Create default teams if `num_teams` specified
- [ ] Assign Host as league_member with role='host'
- [ ] Test multi-role (host can join as player too)

---

### 5.3 Invitations & Team Assignment

**Status:** 🟡 Placeholder; needs logic  
**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/leagues/[id]/join` — Join via link
- `GET /api/leagues/[id]/members` — List league members

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Generate shareable join link (slug-based or secret token)
- [ ] New users sign up on join; existing users auto-added
- [ ] Unassigned players go to allocation bucket
- [ ] Host can manually assign players to teams pre-launch
- [ ] Captain can invite team members (with approval)
- [ ] Duplicate invite handling (same email, prevent re-adding)

---

### 5.4 Team Management

**Status:** 🟡 Placeholder endpoints  
**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/teams` — List user's teams
- `GET /api/teams/[id]` — Get team details
- `PATCH /api/teams/[id]` — Update (Captain/Host)
- `POST /api/teams/[id]/members` — Manage roster

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Captain can manage own team only
- [ ] Host/Governor can move players between teams (pre-launch)
- [ ] Display team progress (submissions, points, streak)
- [ ] Captain removal triggers escalation to Host/Governor
- [ ] Show team captain in member list

---

### 5.5 Workout Submission & Validation

**Status:** 🟡 Endpoints exist; validation logic needs refinement  
**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/submissions` — Submit workout
- `GET /api/submissions/[id]` — Get submission details
- `PATCH /api/submissions/[id]/validate` — Approve/reject
- `GET /api/submissions` — List pending (Captain/Governor)

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Player submits: workout_type, duration, distance, steps, holes, rr_value, proof upload
- [ ] Proof URL stored in Supabase Storage; reference in effortentry
- [ ] Auto-timestamp with user's timezone
- [ ] Duplicate prevention (same date/user/type)
- [ ] Validation hierarchy: Captain (24h) → Governor (override) → Host (final override)
- [ ] Auto-approve after 48h if no Captain validation
- [ ] Flag suspicious entries (e.g., same proof uploaded multiple times)
- [ ] Approved submissions increment points, streak, team score immediately
- [ ] Captain can only validate own team submissions
- [ ] Governor can validate any submission
- [ ] Host can validate any submission and override Captain/Governor

**Client Flows:**
- Player dashboard has "Submit Workout" button → form → upload proof → submit
- Team dashboard shows pending submissions (for Captain)
- Governor/Host dashboard shows all pending submissions across league
- Notification when submission approved/rejected

---

### 5.6 Leaderboards & Scoring

**Status:** 🔴 UI exists; scoring logic needs implementation  
**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/analytics/leaderboard` — League-wide leaderboard
- `GET /api/analytics/team-stats` — Team performance

**Scoring Rules:**
- 1 point per valid submission
- Team score = sum of all member points
- League score = cumulative (all teams)
- Average RR = avg recovery/strain value across member submissions
- Streak = consecutive days with valid submissions (reset on missed day or rejection)

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Leaderboard cache table (refresh hourly or on submission approval)
- [ ] Rank calculation (tie-breaking: secondary sort by avg RR)
- [ ] Historical leaderboards (weekly snapshots)
- [ ] Real-time update on submission approval (update cache immediately)
- [ ] Personal dashboard shows individual rank + team rank
- [ ] Weekly leaderboard view

---

### 5.7 Weekly Challenges (Optional for V2.0)

**Status:** 🔴 Not started  
**Challenges:**
- Bingo (complete specific workout types)
- Max Steps Day (highest step count in a week)
- Unique Day (most unique workout types in a week)

**Implementation (if included):**
- [ ] Define challenge rules in league config
- [ ] Auto-score at end of week
- [ ] Challenge leaderboard separate from main score
- [ ] Bonus points for challenge wins

---

### 5.8 Payments (Stripe Integration)

**Status:** 🟡 Webhook endpoint exists; checkout logic needed  
**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/payments/create-checkout` — Initiate checkout
- `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` — Handle Stripe events

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Host can mark league as paid during creation
- [ ] Set Stripe product ID and pricing
- [ ] Create Stripe Checkout Session (product + quantity)
- [ ] Webhook listens to `checkout.session.completed`
- [ ] On payment success, mark league_members as "paid"
- [ ] Failed payments logged; user can retry
- [ ] Subscription renewals (if applicable)

---

## 6. Middleware & Security

### 6.1 Middleware Rules (`src/middleware.ts`)

**Current Implementation:**
- Redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`
- Redirect incomplete profiles to `/complete-profile`
- Redirect complete profiles away from `/complete-profile`
- Protect routes: `/dashboard`, `/team`, `/leaderboards`, `/rules`, `/my-challenges`, `/governor`, `/profile`

**Future Enhancements:**
- [ ] Role-based route protection (e.g., `/governor` → Governor role required)
- [ ] League-specific route guards (e.g., user must be member of league being accessed)

### 6.2 RLS Policies (Supabase)

**Principle:** Users can only see/modify data they own or are authorized for.

**Key Policies:**
- `users` → Users see only their own profile; Admins see all
- `leagues` → Public leagues visible to all; exclusive/private filtered by membership
- `league_members` → Users see only their own memberships; Host/Governor see all in their league
- `effortentry` → Players see own; Captains see team's; Governors/Host see all
- `teams` → Players see own team; Captains see own; Governors/Host see all

### 7.2 Code Style & Conventions

**TypeScript:**
- Strict mode enabled (`strict: true`)
- Use interfaces for external APIs; types for internal state
- Avoid `any`; use proper typing or generics

**React Components:**
- Use `"use client"` at the top of client components
- Prefer server components by default (in app router)
- Use hooks for state management; Context API for shared auth state
- CSS modules or Tailwind for styling

**API Routes:**
- Handle errors with descriptive messages
- Return `{ error, code }` on failure; `{ data, success }` on success
- Check auth via `getServerSession(authOptions)` in protected routes
- Validate input with Zod schemas
- Log suspicious activity (audit trail)

**Database Queries:**
- Use Supabase client (`getSupabase()` for SSR, service key for admin ops)
- Consolidate DB logic in `src/lib/services/*` to avoid duplication
- Add type safety with TypeScript (use generated Supabase types)
- Implement RLS policies for row-level security

**Session Management:**
- JWT callback should be minimal (no DB reads during token refresh)
- Use `/api/auth/refresh-profile` for explicit profile updates
- Client calls `session.update({ name, needsProfileCompletion })` after profile changes
- Session token updates immediately so UI reflects changes without logout

## 8. Development Workflow

### 8.1 Local Setup
```bash
# Clone & install
git clone <repo> && cd MFLV2
npm install

# Environment setup
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in NEXTAUTH_SECRET, Supabase keys, Stripe keys, SMTP config

# Run dev server
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### 8.2 Branch Convention
- `main` → production
- `testing` → staging/QA
- `feature/*` → feature branches (branch from `testing`)
- Merge back to `testing` → PR review → merge to `main`

### 8.3 Commit Message Format
```
[FEATURE|FIX|CHORE|DOCS] Brief description (50 chars max)

Longer explanation if needed.
- Bullet points for context
- Issue #123 (if applicable)
```

## 10. Coding Agent Instructions

**For all new features, follow this checklist:**

1. **Role & Permission Check**
   - Verify role hierarchy (Host > Governor > Captain > Player)
   - Check `token.role` in middleware or `session.user.role` in components
   - Deny access if insufficient permissions

2. **Database Operations**
   - Use `getSupabase()` for SSR; service key for admin ops
   - Consolidate queries in `src/lib/services/*` if logic is reused
   - Implement RLS policies for security
   - Always validate input with Zod

3. **API Endpoint Structure**
   ```typescript
   import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
   import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth/next';
   import { authOptions } from '@/lib/auth/config';

   export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
     try {
       const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
       if (!session?.user?.id) {
         return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
       }

       const body = await req.json();
       // Validate input
       // Process request
       // Return response

       return NextResponse.json({ data: result, success: true });
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error:', error);
       return NextResponse.json(
         { error: 'Internal Server Error' },
         { status: 500 }
       );
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Client-Side Session Updates**
   - After profile/auth changes, call `session.update({ key: value })`
   - Include only whitelisted fields: `name`, `needsProfileCompletion`, `email`
   - Verify changes appear immediately in UI without logout

5. **Error Handling**
   - Return meaningful error messages (avoid generic "error occurred")
   - Log errors server-side for debugging
   - Show user-friendly messages in UI

6. **Testing New Endpoints**
   - Test happy path (valid input)
   - Test error path (missing/invalid input)
   - Test permissions (unauthorized access)
   - Test with multiple roles if applicable

## 11. FAQ & Common Issues

**Q: Why are DB reads removed from JWT callback?**  
A: JWT callback is called frequently (on each request). DB reads in it cause unnecessary load. Use `/api/auth/refresh-profile` for explicit updates instead.

**Q: How do users switch roles in the UI?**  
A: Role switcher dropdown in navbar (coming soon). Switching updates `session.user.role` and re-renders relevant dashboards/menus.

**Q: How are submissions validated?**  
A: Captain validates first (24h window) → Governor can override → Host can override. Auto-approve after 48h if no action. Points/streak increment on approval.

**Q: How is the leaderboard scored?**  
A: 1 point per valid submission. Team score = sum of members. Ranked by points (primary) then avg RR (secondary). Cache refreshed hourly or on submission.

**Q: Can a user be in multiple leagues?**  
A: Yes. `league_members` table stores user's role per league. Each league may have different role.
